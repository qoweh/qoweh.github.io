[Briefly introduce yourself and your community. Include its name, your role, the topics it focuses on, and its duration of existence. Also, share any milestones your community has achieved.]

Hello, I’m Minwoo Kim, lived in South Korea. I am studying Computer Science at University(KNUT - KOREA NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF TRANSPORTATION), and i’m junior in college.

I have the personality to put everything into what I am interested in. I often test my physical limitations by walking 55km for a day or taking the challenge of climbing and descending mountains over 1,000m above sea level within 2 hours. Similarly, I have always found a field where I will devote my passion, and I would like to briefly introduce my college life.
In my first year, I was interested in social values through supporters of the human rights center on campus, the Good Neighbors campaign, and working at public kindergartens. 
In my second year, I had an additional 42 Gyeongsan curriculum with the university along with the activities of the web development club “멋쟁이사자처럼 (aka likelion)” 42 Gyeongsan is a curriculum I ran from October last year to June this year. 
In my third year, I am working as a backend management in “멋쟁이사자처럼 (aka likelion)”, and I am currently participating on an artificial intelligence open source project at OSSCA (Open Source Contribution Academy) during my vacation.
Recently, by developing a quiz-solving site using LLM as a side project, I became very interested in Generative AI and the possibility of LLM, and I had a desire to promote it to more people.
——-——-——-——-——-——-——-——-——-——-—

Initially, I want to let you know about community that i participated. These are “42 gyeongsan” -  non profit organization founded in Paris and “멋쟁이사자처럼 (aka likelion)” - union web dev club present in universities all over the country.

In “42 gyeongsan”, I was studying System programming by C language, as a Student. I wanted to learn more than what I learned at university, and I wanted to meet various and passionate people outside of university. Its education purpose is studying how to study about computer science and programming. Because there is no teacher, no books.
It's a way to solve a specific task and pass it when you're evaluated three times by a colleague. It's a way to learn how, what, and who to study with in one cycle. 
I studied during 2024.10.01. ~ 2025.06.24. and went back and forth between the university(KNUT) in Chungju and Gyeongsan(42 gyeongsan). It was really hard for me without transportation because it was 4 hours one way, and now I quit in June to put my passion elsewhere.

In “멋쟁이사자처럼”, I was mentor and mentee. In the second grade(the year 2024), I first started club activities as a baby lion - mentee. Since I had no experience in web development, I thought it would be good to study with the club people, so I joined. In the junior in college(the year 2025), I started leading backend team as mentor. Since I started without knowing anything about web development and was mentee, I was able to fill in the gaps by communicating well with people who were developing for the first time.
From this time on, I became more sympathetic to the saying ”If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together” - Traditional African oral proverb.
We are achieved several hackaton that provides a particular web service - a community website for foreign workers in Korea and a website that guides foreigners to the spicy taste of food. I developed part of backend using Spring Boot and deployed the server using IaaS.

[Share details about the events your community have organized in the past year. Please provide links to your community's online presence where we can further explore its activities and initiatives.]

In “멋쟁이사자처럼” when early March this year, at the beginning of the semester, I had a session dealing with git & github. Since there were people who were new to git, I thought about how to proceed with the session. The GUI environment would be more convenient than the CLI in this context, so I explained version management, a characteristic of git, and briefly explained commit and push, remote repository, local repository, and staging area. In addition, I conducted a practice of uploading files to a specific repository using GitKraken, an open-source GUI tool. → https://qoweh.github.io/portfolio.html#git--github-session 

In “멋쟁이사자처럼” when early February this year, other school executives(mentor) gathered at "멋쟁이사자처럼" for a month  to conduct a hackathon - aka trenditon. Perhaps mentor got together, the development speed was faster than expected, but it seems that the schedule was a little delayed because each of them had a different schedule because of non-face-to-face and vacation. We created a website to inform the spicy level of Korean spicy food, which is becoming famous like spicy chicken noodles, in an easy-to-understand manner. → https://qoweh.github.io/portfolio.html#trenditon

[Can you tell us about a time when you took the lead in your community to address a challenge? Please share the outcome, and how you would leverage your experience and the resources provided by the GitHub Campus Experts program to handle current or future obstacles.]

First of all, in “42 gyeongsan”, there is a problem with peer evaluation.
The evaluator checks whether the evaluation items written on the evaluation sheet are satisfied, and asks the evaluatee about tasks other than the evaluation sheet, but problems may sometimes arise because the criteria for fail or pass vary from person to person.
Most Koreans are educated in middle and high school, including myself, they are not used to talking to each other because they do not do much talking activities such as discussion. In this case, first of all, I calmly listened to the other person's think and talked about my thoughts. It takes longer to evaluate than usual, but the effect of learning was deeper because I unknowingly focused more and explained while defending the other person's question. I learned that mutual respect is necessary and that it is important not to take feedback emotionally.
Second, when leading the backend part as a mentor in likelion, there were several mentor but no one did anything, such as conducting a session. Because it's hard to prepare and it's not easy to explain and speak in front of people, I understand cause I do. I thought that if I show an example of challenging myself, other mentor and mentee might also do the same. It's also because of my personality who likes to challenge so much.


Let me introduce my current obstacle I think of. Twice at school, I tried activities to learn specific skills together or introduce skills in the form of Demo Day. Unfortunately, however, there were no participants. It was because of my lack, but I wonder if people will watch with more interest if i belong to the GitHub Campus Expert community because everyone who is programming knows GitHub. Perhaps this idea sounds like an excuse.
Also, if possible, I would like to operate Demo Day thing using GitHub Copilot with small rewards such as github goods. Recently, I became very interested in MCP and AI Agent, and I developed it using Agent Mode in VSC. I would like to experience a really impressive effect and share this experience.

Finally, I will introduce you to the obstacles that I think of. I know that there are currently github campus experts in Korea, but I want to contribute to GCE Korea community because it seems that activities have not been active since around 2021, i think. Also, I was able to check out the existing github campus.expert site, but it is located only in Seoul and Jeju, and it is not in other regions, so I want to work as a github campus expert in the center of Korea. 
In South Korea, infrastructure is concentrated in Seoul. hackathons, conferences and various events are all held in Seoul. So, I want to help people who work hard alone in places other than Seoul or Jeju like me.

[필수] Google Student Ambassador 지원 동기를 작성해주세요.**

안녕하세요. 저는 한국교통대학교 충주캠퍼스에서 소프트웨어전공을 공부하는 3학년 김민우입니다.

저는 주로 백엔드 개발을 공부하며 작지만 여러 프로젝트에 참여해본 경험이 있습니다.
팀 프로젝트에서는 특히, 기획과 개발을 함께 맡아서 팀원들을 조율하고 열정을 나누는 일을 즐깁니다. 열정적인 사람들이 모여 만들어내는 시너지와 긍정적인 에너지를 좋아하는데, 그런 환경에서는 서로가 에너지를 증폭시켜 더욱 성장할 수 있기 때문입니다.

저는 관심있는 것에 모든 것을 끈기있게 쏟아부는 성격을 가졌습니다. 하루 12시간동안 55km를 걷거나, 해발 1,000m 이상의 산을 2시간 내에 오르내리는 도전을 하며 스스로의 육체적 한계를 시험하곤 합니다. 비슷하게 저는 제 열정을 쏟을 분야를 항상 찾아왔고, 대학 생활과 관련해서 간략하게 소개해 드리고 싶습니다.

- 1학년 때는 교내 인권센터 서포터즈, 굿네이버스 캠페인, 공립유치원 근로를 통해 사회적 가치에 관심을 가졌고,
- 2학년 때는 웹 개발 동아리 ‘멋쟁이사자처럼’ 활동과 함께 추가적으로 42경산 교육과정을 대학과 병행했습니다. 42경산은 제가 작년 10월부터 올해 6월까지 진행했던 교육과정입니다.
- 3학년 때는 멋쟁이사자처럼의 백엔드 운영진으로 활동 중이며, 현재 방학에는 OSSCA(오픈소스 컨트리뷰션 아카데미)에서 인공지능 오픈소스 프로젝트에 참여 중입니다.

최근에는 LLM을 활용한 퀴즈 풀이 사이트를 사이드 프로젝트로 개발하며 생성형 AI와 LLM의 가능성에 큰 흥미를 가지게 되었고, 이를 더 많은 사람들에게 알리고 싶다는 열망이 생겼습니다.

비록 직접적인 마케팅 경험은 부족하지만, SPA 브랜드에서 3개월간 일하며 고객 응대와 홍보 및 전단지 돌리기 등 과 같은 경험도 해보았습니다. 낯선 분야에 빠르게 적응하는 자신감과 의지, 열정이 있습니다.

Google Student Ambassador와 같은 열정적인 커뮤니티 속에서 함께 배우고 나누며 제 열정을 자연스럽게 발휘하고 싶습니다.

신청 동기, 계획, 목표 등의 내용이 들어갑니다.

[필수] 이전에 참여했던 Ambassador 활동이나 마케팅 관련 경험이 있다면 구체적으로 작성해주세요.
- 활동 주최 기업, 기간, 간략한 활동 내용 필수 포함

마케팅 관련 경험 3가지를 소개드리고 싶습니다.

2023.04.12. ~ 2023.11.15. :
첫 번째로, 대학교 1학년 때 교내 인권센터 서포터즈로 활동을 했습니다. 주로 인권 교육을 받거나 인권 센터 홍보를 했고, 부스 운영 혹은 참여형 활동 그리고 포스터를 만들어 학생들에게 인권센터를 홍보했습니다.

2023.11.11. ~ 2023.11.17.  :
두 번째로, 굿네이버스 경기2본부에서 NGO Traveler 캠페인에 참여했습니다. 어떻게 하면 효과적으로 ‘건강 불평등’을 널리 알릴 지 캠페인을 만들었습니다.

2024.12.02. ~ 2024.12.06. :
세 번째로, UC Berkeley SCET의 리더십 강의를 5일간 경주 켄싱턴 리조트에서 집중 교육받았습니다. 고정 관념을 깨는 생각들과 커뮤니케이션 하는 방법을 여러 활동들을 통해 깨달았습니다. 특히, 색연필 한 자루를 물물교환하는 활동에서, 1시간 동안 걸어다니며 20여번의 거절과 4번의 성공을 통해 쿠키 3개 → 핸드크림 → 가게에서 판매하는 티백 제품 → 오리온 맥주의 키링으로 물물교환했습니다. 이를 통해 거절에 익숙해졌고, 거절을 감정적으로 받아들이지 않고 더 나은 도전을 위한 피드백으로 받아들이게 되었습니다.

[필수] 대학생을 대상으로 Google Gemini를 효과적으로 알리기 위한 아이디어를 1가지 제안해 주세요.
프롬프트 작성 요령과 같이 쉽게 따라할 수 있는 문서를 공유해줍니다.
주로 학생들은 과제에 LLM을 사용하기 때문에 LLM의 용도와 적용 범위의 한계가 없다는 것을 보여주기 위해서,
다양한 전공을 가진 대학생들의 빠르고 효과적인 학습 결과를 보여주는 아이디어가 좋을 것 같습니다.
```
```
[필수] Google AI Pro를 무료로 구독할 수 있게 된다면, 자신이 속한 학교의 학생들이 더 많이 구독할 수 있도록 하는 구체적인 마케팅 방법을 1가지 제안해주세요.
고전적인 방법이지만, 축제 시기 혹은 주기적으로 대면 마케팅, 참여형 부스를 운영하는 방법입니다. Google AI Pro를 활용하여 어떠한 문제를 해결하거나 제품의 성능을 느낄 수 있는 참여형 활동을 진행하면 학생들에게 인상깊은 홍보가 될 것 같습니다.
